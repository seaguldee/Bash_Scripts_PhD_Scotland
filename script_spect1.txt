#This is a bit of a tedious script.  First it searches for all directory names that finish with an 8,9 or 10 and insert them into a file called spectroscopy_files.  Then it checks the number of files in this output to remove anything with greater than 3 files (removes resting state files labelled with 8,9,10).  Then it outputs all of these potential directories to start on script_spect2.

find /sdata/images/projects/ASD_MM/1/scans/asd_* -maxdepth 3 -mindepth 3 -name "9" -o -name "9_*" >> /sdata/images/projects/ASD_MM/1/datafiles/spectroscopy_files
